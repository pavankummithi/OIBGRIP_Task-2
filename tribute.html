        <h1>Mahatma Gandhi</h1>
        <img src="gandhi.jpg" alt="Mahatma Gandhi">
        <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi, was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist,
            and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's
            independence from British Rule and in turn inspire movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.</p>
        <p>He was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, India. Gandhi studied law in London and became a barrister.
            After facing discrimination and prejudice in South Africa, he developed his concept of Satyagraha (truth-force)
            as a method of nonviolent resistance to oppression.</p>
        <p>Gandhi returned to India in 1915 and led various campaigns against British rule. He advocated for nonviolent
            civil disobedience and launched the famous Salt March in 1930, where thousands of Indians marched to the Arabian
            Sea to make their own salt in protest against the British salt monopoly.</p>
        <p>Gandhi's teachings and philosophy of nonviolence, simplicity, and truth continue to inspire people around the
            world. He was assassinated on January 30, 1948, but his legacy as the "Father of the Nation" in India lives on.</p>
